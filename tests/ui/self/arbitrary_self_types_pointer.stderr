   = help: consider changing to `self`, `&self`, `&mut self`, or a type implementing `Receiver`: for example `self: Box<Self>`, `self: Rc<Self>`, `self: Arc<Self>`, or `self: Pin<P>` (where P is one of the previous types except `Self`). Raw pointers do not implement Receiver. Consider wrapping your pointer in a newtype wrapper for which you implement Receiver.
